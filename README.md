📈 Predicting Future Store Sales with AI

This project focuses on forecasting future store sales using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates how historical sales data can be analyzed, processed, and modeled to predict future sales trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

The analysis begins with data exploration and preprocessing to understand sales patterns, seasonality, and trends. Feature engineering techniques are applied to transform raw time-series data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. Predictive models are then trained to learn historical behavior and generate future sales forecasts.

By leveraging AI-based forecasting methods, this project aims to improve demand planning, inventory management, and revenue optimization for retail businesses.
